INSTALL file for libmikmod
==========================

In most systems just run:
 $ ./configure
 $ make

You need GNU make.  On BSD or SysV systems, you may need to use gmake
instead of make.  Use ./configure --help to see configuration options.
To install the library and development components, run "make install"
as the superuser.  This will install the shared and static libraries,
header file and pkg-config file into directories under /usr/local or a
different location selected with the --prefix option in configure.

To cross-compile, you will need to use the --host option of configury.
For example:
 $ ./configure --host=i686-pc-mingw32        # for Windows (win32)
 $ ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32     # for Windows (win64)

We also provide standalone makefiles for Windows which you can use for
both compiling on the relevant native system, or for cross-compiling.
