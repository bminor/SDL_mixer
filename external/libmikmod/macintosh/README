  Hello folks !


This is libmikmod, version 3.1.21, a portable sound library for Unix.
Check out the file 'NEWS' for more history information.


>> BUILDING LIBMIKMOD
---------------------

- If you're not building libmikmod for the Macintosh, then you're lost
  in the sources. Go up one directory, and read the main README file.

So, you're on one of those esthetically-challenged Apple boxes ? Or on a
sober but nice classic beige box ? With a near-buttonless mouse ?

libmikmod can be built using Metrowerks Codewarrior (Version Pro 5 being
used to create the project file) and Apple MPW (only tested with CW
compilers).

Read the file INSTALL in this directory for compilation instructions.
The projects will generate code for 68k as well as PowerPC processors.

HTML documentation of the library, for programmers, is located in the
doc directory.

For more information on this port, please contact Anders Bjoerklund

>> THANKS
---------

We would like to thank everyone who contributed to libmikmod. Their
names are in the AUTHORS file for the significative contributions, but
some other names can be found in the NEWS file. Thanks a lot ! Keeping
libmikmod alive wouldn't be much fun without you.
